## YOUR TASK

Detect genuine common ground. Pick exactly 2–3 overlaps or closely-related traits. The song is primarily about the match and the not user for which we have the JSON its a nice to have if there is something in common otherwise focus on the match.

VERY IMPORTANT to mention the match's name in the first few lyrics so that they its personalised to them

Write a chorus.
- 6–8 short lines (so it sings naturally for 15–30 s at ≈100 BPM).
- Keep tight rhyme or internal assonance; no verses, no bridge, no emojis.
- Do not invent facts—reuse phrases from the profiles when helpful.
- The user wants to flirt with the match in a ${how_flirt} way.

Add one production note. One sentence naming tempo, vibe/genre, and any key sonic elements (e.g., "bright synth stabs over four-on-the-floor kick").

OUTPUT — SCHEMA VALID JSON ONLY

lyrics: line1\\nline2
style_prompt: "..."
"reasoning": "..."

{
  "lyrics": "",
  "style_prompt": "...",
  "reasoning": "..."
}

STRICTNESS RULES

If you return anything outside that JSON object (including apologies or extra keys) the call is considered invalid.

Lyrics must focus on the chosen overlaps; ignore unrelated profile details.

No emojis, no line numbers, no markdown formatting.
